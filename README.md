First I made a main function and put 3 variables called operationselect, num1, and num2 and made them all integers so you can put numbers in them.
Then I put an if/elif/else statement inside it to make the two numbers get added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided depending on what number was entered by the user. 
Then I made a function for each type of operation for it to return the two numbers added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided. 
Then I put a print statement that tells the user to select their operation based on a number 1-4.
Then at the end I called the main fuction so that the program would work properly.
